		<h1>Scrath project #1</h1>
		<p>Scratch is a basic computer programming tool that can be used to make games and videos and other interactive activities.</p>
		<p> This is my frist scrath project at dvc. This project is a game, and the goal is to get the gobbo into the red goal. One player is the golie and the other player is the cat who
		is trying to get the gobbo ball into the right side of the screen/ gobbo ball</p>

		<h1>App Inventor- Teacher Quiz</h1>
		<p> Our next major project was to create an App through MIT App inventor. For our project, Chelsey and I created a teacher quiz for new students to use, and to get to know the staff.<p>

	<h1> American Dream Survey Chart </h1>
	<p> For this delivearble we had to create a project to present for exhibition. First we had to survey people around Korea Town and Hollywood, and once we compiled all the data we had to turn it into charts and observations. </p>
	<center><img src="image/boxplot1.PNG" height="500" width="600"/></center>
	<p> Some observations you can creat from this are as follows</p>
	<p>Qualitative: People tend to agree that race is a factor that will economically affect you.</p>
	<p>Quantitative: Over 75% of women believe that race strongly determines their ability to move up possibly because they are more open to racial issues that currently exsist. 
	On a whole 5/7 people surveyed belived that race determined wether or not you would mve up economically.</p>
	<h1> Checker board DP/BOOTSTRAP</h1>
	<p>During this section of computer science we learned how to apply a structural layout to any online page, with this knowledge we could create a grid that we can enter and rearrange to our preference. </p>
	<p>Bootstrap is the program that allows us to creat this strcture because it lays out or site according to rows and columns that we can adjust. </p>
	<center><a href="check.html"><img src="image/Checker.PNG" height="500" width="600"/></a></center>
	<p>To test our skills we were given an awakward arangement of boxes and were told to change the color and rearange them into a checkboard that is shown above.</p>
